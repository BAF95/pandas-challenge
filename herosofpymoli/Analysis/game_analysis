Since the male population is nearly 5 times the size of the female and other combined it would make sense to tailor the game to that demographic to encourage purchasing. This does not tell the whole story,
as the age of the players matters as well. Considering that the player base is almost whole confined to the 29 year old or less demo, it would be best to go after that demographic,
while tailoring microtransactions to the 15-29 age group since they would have the most disposable income while representing the largest swath of people playing. It appears that, final critic and othbreaker last hope of
impending storm are the top selling items, adding more microtransactions based these items designs or attributes would certainly bode well for purchases.
