There are a couple of conclusions that can be drawn from the school data. Firstly, money does not translate to academic success, as we see in the funding per student compared to test score, the schools with less funding do
better. I believe this can be attributed to size rather than funding, as its already established less students per class perform better. Secondly, charter schools are far more successful than district school. An explanation
for this I would attribute the different structures of schools. Charter schools fire teachers who perform badly, whereas district school offer tenure, and can institutionalize incompetent educators, by offering
permanent, positions. Over time this would cause the discrepancy in the data we see.
Finally, the grade of the student has little impact on scores between years. This is highlighted above, when comparing charter vs. district schools. Since subjects build off each other, it would make sense that
an institution that teaches poorly at 9th grade, will teach poorly at 12th, since the gaps in knowledge would prevent better scores by large margins.
